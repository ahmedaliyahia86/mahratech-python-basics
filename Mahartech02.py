#Comments are important to make sure that you and others can understand what your code is about.
#To add comments to your Python script, you can use the # tag. These comments are not run as Python code,
#so they will not influence your result.
#As you can see in the above output, python ignores the first line, # Division, during execution.
#Why should you write comments in your code? 
#Have you ever tried reading your own previously written code to a project after some time away?
#You’ll likely have forgotten some of the details. 
#Writing good comments can save you time by summarizing your overall approach.
#Today, most software is written collaboratively, 
#whether by a group of employees at one company or a group of people working together on an open source project.
#Skilled programmers expect to see comments in code,
#so it’s best to start adding descriptive comments to your programs now.
